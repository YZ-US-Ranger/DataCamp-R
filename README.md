# DataCamp-R

Parallel slopes models are so-named because we can visualize these models in the data space as not one line, but two parallel lines. To do this, we'll draw two things:

a scatterplot showing the data, with color separating the points into groups

a line for each value of the categorical variable

```
# Augment the model. The augment() function from the broom package provides an easy way to add the fitted values to our data frame
augmented_mod <- augment(mod)
glimpse(augmented_mod)

# scatterplot, with color
data_space <- ggplot(data=augmented_mod, aes(x = wheels, y = totalPr, color = cond)) + 
  geom_point()
  
# single call to geom_line()
data_space + 
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted))
  
# Note that this approach has the added benefit of automatically coloring the lines appropriately to match the data.  
```

Use geom_smooth() to add the logistic regression line

```
# scatterplot with jitter
data_space <- ggplot(data = MedGPA, aes(y = Acceptance, x = GPA)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.5)

# add logistic curve
data_space +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", se = FALSE, method.args = list(family = "binomial"))
```

We need to tell the glm() function which member of the GLM family we want to use. To do this, we will pass the family argument to glm() as a list using the method.args argument to geom_smooth(). This mechanism is common in R, and allows one function to pass a list of arguments to another function.
